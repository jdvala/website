<p>There will be a time in ones life when one has to search something on google and wondered only if I could have some more functionality to refine my search. Well there is but for those who seek, will find it.</p>

<p>Google is a very powerfull tool for the ones who know how to use it. I myself was unaware of some of theses and got to know it when I was presented with a problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-operators">The operators</h2>
<h3 id="minus--">Minus <code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code></h3>
<p>Consider a situation where you are trying to search for <code class="highlighter-rouge">best laptop</code> but you are not interested in Apple products so instead of searching <code class="highlighter-rouge">best laptops</code> you can search <code class="highlighter-rouge">best laptops -apple</code> and you will only be presented with the best of windows laptops.</p>

<h3 id="quotations-">Quotations <code class="highlighter-rouge">""</code></h3>
<p>This is particularly useful when you want to preserve the oder of the search. Results of <code class="highlighter-rouge">"heavy off road vehicals"</code> will be different from <code class="highlighter-rouge">heavy off road vehicals</code>. This technique is refered to as <em>Exact Search</em></p>

<h3 id="search-a-single-website">Search a single website.</h3>
<p>There are ocassions when we just want to find a particular thing on a single website. Consider during <em>Black Friday</em> you want to search <code class="highlighter-rouge">amazon.com</code> and not some other shaddy website which is offering a brand new iPhone for very cheap. Hence, if we want to search a product only on amazon then we can do something like this <code class="highlighter-rouge">iPhone site:amazon.com</code>. This will ensure that your search will be performed on amazon and you wont be shown or at least the first results will be from amazon.</p>

<h3 id="search-for-page-title-or-on-page-title">Search for page title or on page title</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Germany intitle:BMW</code> and it will return sites that are about germany and have a title BMW in it. Also, there is <code class="highlighter-rouge">allintitle:&lt;words&gt;</code> which can be used for multiple words.</p>

<h3 id="search-in-urls">Search in URLs</h3>
<p>Similar to the above one, you can search for words if they appear in the URL with <code class="highlighter-rouge">inurl:&lt;words&gt;</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">allinurl:&lt;words&gt;</code></p>

<h3 id="search-text-on-a-site">Search Text on a site</h3>
<p>If you want to search for some text phrases on a website then you can do this by <code class="highlighter-rouge">intext:&lt;word&gt;</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">allintext:&lt;words&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3 id="search-for-file-types">Search for file types</h3>
<p>If you want to search for downloadable files, you can do it by <code class="highlighter-rouge">filetype:&lt;pdf/txt...etc&gt;</code>. Example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">ISO 9001 filetype:pdf</code></p>

<h3 id="related-website">Related website</h3>
<p>This has happened to all of us. We like a website and we want to see what other options are available to us. In that case we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">related:&lt;known website of interest&gt;</code>. Example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">related:distrowatch.org</code></p>

<h3 id="placeholders">Placeholders</h3>
<p>This has to be one of the most interesting one of all. Did it ever happen to you that you forgot a few words of a lyric or a quote or a film dialoge? You can search google with a placeholder just for this purpose. Example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Life is like a * *, you never know what you are gonna get</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> are refered as palceholders. You place it at either side of the forgotten words or phrases and you are pretty much done.</p>

<h3 id="time-restrictions">Time restrictions</h3>
<p>This filter is particularly useful when you want to restrict information before or after certiain time period. Particularly useful in case of news articles. To use this option <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tools &gt; Any time</code> and then select anytime that one wants.</p>
